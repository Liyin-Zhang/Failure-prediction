# Weather Aware Feeder Fault Prediction

This repository accompanies research on weather aware feeder fault prediction in distribution systems. The focus is graph structured modeling and the synthesis of rare fault events.

## Components
1. **GNN based predictor**  
   Feeder level fault risk estimation using meteorological and infrastructure features while respecting network topology.
2. **Conditional GAN based generator**  
   Synthesis of rare fault samples with preserved topological and statistical consistency to mitigate class imbalance and improve robustness.

## Data availability
Due to confidentiality of utility data, original datasets are not released at this time. Deidentified sample data and minimal runnable examples will be provided later to support reproduction and validation.

## Project status
The codebase is under active organization and continuous upload. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
